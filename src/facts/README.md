These are ad hoc tools to help development of this app (and any other app that uses the events/facts based persistence).

The [viewer](http://localhost:3000/factViewer.html) displays a chronological log of facts that are in the history db.

The diagram displays the different type of facts and their relations from a static code analysis.  
It is launched independantly:
```
yarn devtools
```

Then open http://localhost:3001/factDiagram.html.
